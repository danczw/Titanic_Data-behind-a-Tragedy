Predicting survival of a disaster based on passenger features.

The RMS Titanic was a passenger ship of the British shipping company White Star Line. She was built in Belfast at the shipyard of Harland & Wolff and was the largest ship in the world when it was commissioned on April 2, 1912. Because of the circumstances associated with her sinking, the Titanic is one of the most famous ships in history.

On her maiden voyage, the Titanic collided with an iceberg about 300 nautical miles southeast of Newfoundland at about 23:40 on 14 April 1912 and sank two hours and 40 minutes later. Although more than two hours were available for the evacuation, 1514 of the more than 2200 people on board were killed - mainly because of the insufficient number of lifeboats and the inexperience of the crew in handling them. Because of the high number of victims, the sinking of the Titanic is one of the greatest catastrophes in seafaring history.

Over 1,300 people had booked a passage on the Titanic. Among the passengers were many celebrities from North American and European society. Of the almost 900 members of the ship's crew, about 325 were responsible for the operation of the ship and 500 for the passengers. The remaining persons had other duties, including the eight officers of the ship's command.

The story of the Titanic is main focus of the legendary Titanic Machine Learning competition – often one of the first challenge for to dive into the many Machine Learning available on the internet. As in this use case of machine learning the outcome is already known for every observation (i.e. every passenger), it makes for a great use case of machine learning. The goal is to implement an algorithm that correctly predicts the survival or death of a passenger based on his / her recorded features. Before an algorithm is implemented, an exploratory data analysis is performed.
